/*It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite 
 number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.
9 = 7 + 2×1^2
15 = 7 + 2×2^2
21 = 3 + 2×3^2
25 = 7 + 2×3^2
27 = 19 + 2×2^2
33 = 31 + 2×1^2
It turns out that the conjecture was false.
What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be 
written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?*/
